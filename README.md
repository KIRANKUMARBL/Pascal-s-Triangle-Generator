# Pascal's Triangle Generator

## Description
This Java program generates Pascal's Triangle up to a given number of rows.  
Each row is constructed based on the sum of adjacent elements from the previous row.

## How It Works
- The first and last elements of every row are always 1.
- Any other element is the sum of the two numbers directly above it in the previous row.

## Example
For `numRows = 5`, the output will be:
